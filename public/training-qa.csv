qiang,The <span class='event'>trade</span> between the two countries has been stopped,,,,,What will happen in the future? trade,n,"Only consider the information provided in the passage. All you know from the sentence is that trade is stopped; is it possible that ""trade"" will resume between the two countries later?

qiang,"The bus usually leaves at 10 am every Monday, but it will <span class='event'>leave</span> early tomorrow.",,,,,What is likely to happen tomorrow? leave,y,"The question requires something likely to happen. Something that ""will"" happen will also be likely to happen, so it's correct."

A222XREQ12K58P,"Profit at the unit fell to $110.6 million, or 37 cents a share, from $142.4 million, or 45 cents a share, largely because of a $24 million one-time charge associated with Hughes's previously announced plan to <span class='event'>reduce</span> employment by at least 6,000 people by year end. Even excluding the charge, however, net fell 5%.",,,,,What happened after the net fall? reduce,n,"A correct answer should first start after the net fall, and second, have ended before ""now"". ""Reduce"" doesn't satisfy the second requirement because there's no evidence from the passage saying that the reduction has ended or not. ""Reduce"" would be correct if the question were ""What will happen after the net fall"" or ""What happens after the net fall"" (it's ok to use present tense)."
A222XREQ12K58P,"However, cited by District of Columbia traffic police in December for driving under the influence of alcohol, Farkas <span class='event'>retired</span>.",,,,,What is happening now? retired,n,"Is Farkas retired now? Yes. Then why is this not a correct answer? That's because the passage says ""Farkas retired"", where ""retired"" is an action instead of a state. If the passage were ""Farkas retired at the age of 65 and he has been retired since then"", then the second ""retired"" is a correct answer to this question."
